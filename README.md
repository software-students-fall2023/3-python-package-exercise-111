# LuhnChecker - Credit Card Validation and Generation

[![Build Status](https://github.com/software-students-fall2023/3-python-package-exercise-111/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/software-students-fall2023/3-python-package-exercise-111/actions)

LuhnChecker is a Python library for validating, generating, and processing credit card numbers. This package provides a simple interface to implement the Luhn algorithm (also known as the mod 10 algorithm) which is widely used for validation of identification numbers.

## Features

- Validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm.
- Generate valid credit card numbers for testing purposes.
- Mask credit card numbers for secure display.
- Determine the credit card issuer from the card number.

## Installation

To install LuhnChecker, simply use pip:

```bash
pipenv install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ luhnchecker==0.0.11

```

## Usage

Here's how to use LuhnChecker in your Python code:

### Validating a Credit Card Number

```python
from luhnchecker.luhn import Luhn

card_number = "1234567812345670"
if Luhn.check_luhn(card_number):
    print(f"{card_number} is a valid credit card number.")
else:
    print(f"{card_number} is an invalid credit card number.")
```

### Generating a Credit Card Number

```python
generated_card_number = Luhn.generate_luhn()
print(f"Generated card number: {generated_card_number}")
```

### Masking a Credit Card Number

```python
masked_number = Luhn.mask_card_number(card_number)
print(f"Masked card number: {masked_number}")
```

### Determining the Credit Card Issuer

```python
issuer = Luhn.credit_card_issuer(card_number)
print(f"The issuer of the card number {card_number} is {issuer}.")
```
